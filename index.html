          As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network
          applications. In the following "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each
          connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node.js will sleep.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is in contrast to today's more common concurrency model, in which OS threads are employed. Thread-based
          networking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore, users of Node.js are free from
          worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node.js directly performs
          I/O, so the process never blocks except when the I/O is performed using synchronous methods of Node.js
          standard library. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.js.

        <p>
          Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" doesn't refer to a
          particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven
          architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in
          web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time
          communication programs and browser games).

          The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now
          merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's
          Collaborative Projects program.

        Node.js uses libuv underhood to handle asynchronous events. Libuv is an abstraction layer for network and file
        system functionality on both Windows and POSIX-based systems such as Linux, macOS, OSS on NonStop, and Unix.

    <section class="main-section" id="Threading">
      <header>Threading</header>
      <p>
        Node.js operates on a single-thread event loop, using non-blocking I/O calls, allowing it to support tens of
        thousands of concurrent connections without incurring the cost of thread context switching. The design of
        sharing a single thread among all the requests that use the observer pattern is intended for building highly
        concurrent applications, where any function performing I/O must use a callback. To accommodate the
        single-threaded event loop, Node.js uses the libuv library—which, in turn, uses a fixed-sized thread pool that
        handles some of the non-blocking asynchronous I/O operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        A thread pool handles the execution of parallel tasks in Node.js. The main thread function call posts tasks to
        the shared task queue, which threads in the thread pool pull and execute. Inherently non-blocking system
        functions such as networking translate to kernel-side non-blocking sockets, while inherently blocking system
        functions such as file I/O run in a blocking way on their own threads. When a thread in the thread pool
        completes a task, it informs the main thread of this, which in turn, wakes up and executes the registered
        callback.
      </p>
      <p>
        A downside of this single-threaded approach is that Node.js doesn't allow vertical scaling by increasing the
        number of CPU cores of the machine it is running on without using an additional module, such as cluster,
        StrongLoop Process Manager, or pm2. However, developers can increase the default number of threads in
        the libuv thread pool. The server operating system (OS) is likely to distribute these threads across multiple
        cores. Another problem is that long-lasting computations and other CPU-bound tasks freeze the entire
        event-loop until completion.

          npm is the pre-installed package manager for the Node.js server platform. It installs Node.js programs from
          the npm registry, organizing the installation and management of third-party Node.js programs. Packages in the
          npm registry can range from simple helper libraries such as Lodash to task runners such as Grunt.

          Node.js can be combined with a browser, a database that supports JSON data (such as Postgres,[74] MongoDB, or
          CouchDB) and JSON for a unified JavaScript development stack. With the adaptation of what were essentially
          server-side development patterns such as MVC, MVP, MVVM, etc., Node.js allows the reuse of the same model and
          service interface between client side and server side.

        <p>
          Node.js registers with the operating system so the OS notifies it of connections and issues a callback. Within
          the Node.js runtime, each connection is a small heap allocation. Traditionally, relatively heavyweight OS
          processes or threads handled each connection. Node.js uses an event loop for scalability, instead of processes
          or threads. In contrast to other event-driven servers, Node.js's event loop does not need to be called
          explicitly. Instead, callbacks are defined, and the server automatically enters the event loop at the end of
          the callback definition. Node.js exits the event loop when there are no further callbacks to be performed.

          const bar = () => console.log('bar')

const baz = () => console.log('baz')

const foo = () => {
  console.log('foo')

  baz()
}

          Queuing function execution
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's see how to defer a function until the stack is clear.

          The use case of setTimeout(() => {}, 0) is to call a function, but execute it once every other function in the
          code has executed.

          Take this example:
        </p>
        <code>
          const bar = () => console.log('bar')

const baz = () => console.log('baz')

const foo = () => {
  console.log('foo')
  setTimeout(bar, 0)
  baz()
}

foo()
        </code>


        <p>process.nextTick()</p>
        <p>
          As you try to understand the Node.js event loop, one important part of it is process.nextTick().

          Every time the event loop takes a full trip, we call it a tick.

          When we pass a function to process.nextTick(), we instruct the engine to invoke this function at the end of
          the current operation, before the next event loop tick starts:
        </p>
        <code>
          process.nextTick(() => {
            //do something
          })
        </code>
        <p>The event loop is busy processing the current function code.

        </p>
        <p>calling <code>setTimeOut(() => {}, 0)</code> will execute the function at the end of next tick, much later
          than when using nextTick() which prioritizes the call and executes it just before the beginning of the next
          tick.</p>

          Node.js provides a way to make "addons" via a C-based API called N-API which can be used to produce loadable
          (importable) .node modules from source code written in C/C++. The modules can be directly loaded into memory
          and
          executed from within JS environment as simple CommonJS modules. The implementation of the N-API relies on
          internal C/C++
          Node.js and V8 objects requiring users to import (#include) Node.js specific headers into their native source
          code.
          As Node.js platform constantly evolves the API compatibility is subject to changes and may get broken
          sometimes by a new
          version (as consequence modules have to be built against specific Node.js versions to work correctly). To
          address the
          issue third parties have introduced open-sourced С/С++ wrappers on top of the API that partially alleviate the
          problem.
          They simplify interfaces but as side effect they may also introduce complexity which maintainers have to deal
          with. Even
          though the core functionality of Node.js resides in a JavaScript built-in library, modules written in C++ can
          be used to
          enhance capabilities and to improve performance of applications.

      <article>
        The Event Loop is one of the most important aspects to understand about Node.js.
        <p>
          Blocking the event loop
          Any JavaScript code that takes too long to return back control to the event loop will block the execution of
          any
          JavaScript code in the page, even block the UI thread, and the user cannot click around, scroll the page, and
          so on.

          Almost all the I/O primitives in JavaScript are non-blocking. Network requests, filesystem operations, and so
          on. Being
          blocking is the exception, and this is why JavaScript is based so much on callbacks, and more recently on
          promises and
          async/await.

      <header>The call stack</header>
      <article>
        The call stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack.
        The event loop continuously checks the call stack to see if there's any function that needs to run.
        While doing so, it adds any function call it finds to the call stack and executes each one in order.

      <header>C++ addons</header>
      <article>
        Addons are dynamically-linked shared objects written in C++. The require() function can load addons as ordinary
        Node.js
        modules. Addons provide an interface between JavaScript and C/C++ libraries.
        <p>
          This "Hello world" example is a simple addon, written in C++, that is the equivalent of the following
          JavaScript code:
        </p>
        <code>
          module.exports.hello = () => 'world';
        </code>
        <p>
          First, create the file hello.cc:
        </p>
        <code>
          // addon.cc
#include <node.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

using node::AddEnvironmentCleanupHook;
using v8::HandleScope;
using v8::Isolate;
using v8::Local;
using v8::Object;

    <section class="main-section" id="Worker_support">
      <header>Worker Support</header>

      In order to be loaded from multiple Node.js environments, such as a main thread and a Worker thread, an add-on
      needs to either:
      <article>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Be an Node-API addon, or
          </li>
          <li>
            Be declared as context-aware using NODE_MODULE_INIT() as described above
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to support Worker threads, addons need to clean up any resources they may have allocated when such
            a thread exists. This can be achieved through the usage of the AddEnvironmentCleanupHook() function:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <code>
            void AddEnvironmentCleanupHook(v8::Isolate* isolate,
                               void (*fun)(void* arg),
                               void* arg);
